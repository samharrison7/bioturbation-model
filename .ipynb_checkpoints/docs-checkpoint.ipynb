    "# Bioturbation example\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very simple script to demonstrate modelling of how bioturbation effects concentration of a substance in a layered soil model, where a certain depth of each layer is mixed with the depth of the neighboroughing layer(s) on each time step. The depth to mix is a function of earthworm density in the layer.\n",

    "\n",
    "The soil profile is split into a number $L$ of soil layers, each with a depth $d_l$ [m] (where $l \\in \\{ 1, ..., L \\}$) and concentration of substance $\\text{[A]}_l$ [kg/m<sup>3</sup>]. Each pair of layers has a so-called \"bioturbation rate\" $k_{\\text{bioturb},l:l+1} [s<sup>-1</sup>], which we define as:\n",

    "    k_{\\text{bioturb},l:l+1} = \\frac{m_{l:l+1}}{d_l}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $m_{l:l+1}$ [m/s] is the depth of each layer ($l$ and $l+1$) that is mixed each second due to bioturbation. Thus, for a time step of length $\\delta t$, $\\delta t m_{l:l+1}$ is mixed between the layers on each time step. $m_{l:l+1}$ itself might be a function of earthworm density, amongst other things.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we assume that, on each model time step $t$, $m_{l:l+1} \\delta t$ is instantaneously mixed between the layers $l$ and $l+1$, then the concentration of substance in layer $l$ on the time step $t+1$ is given by:\n",
